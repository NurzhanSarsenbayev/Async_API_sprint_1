Based on some information he learns, Bucky believes that destiny is to become a porn star, despite he being a virgin and only having recently learned what masturbation is. With his parents' blessing, Bucky hops on a bus to Los Angeles to make it big there as a porn star. He is taken under the wings of a few people in LA. On the professional side, he meets the reigning king of porn, Dick Shadow, who only sees in Bucky a laughing stock. But washed up porn director Miles Deep stumbles across what he sees as an untapped niche market for Bucky's limited talents. Miles has the challenge of trying to convince investors who only see in Bucky the antithesis of porn. On the personal side, Bucky befriends a young diner waitress Kathy McGee, who helps Bucky find a place to live - albeit with an insensitive oaf named Gary who only wants to get into Kathy's pants - and navigate general life in the big city. Kathy, however, is facing her own demons in working toward her destiny, those demons which Bucky hopes he can help her beat down.", "genres": [{"uuid": "7c3697f0-880d-4852-9e6d-397573e1ab74", "name": "Comedy"}], "actors": [{"uuid": "1ce84ac1-aaa0-4509-9b4e-b09ae495cd3b", "full_name": "Christina Ricci"}, {"uuid": "b8f42d8d-64f8-4f83-abd3-50a8037cc936", "full_name": "Don Johnson"}, {"uuid": "161bf1fc-5eaa-483f-bf44-365851513a9d", "full_name": "Nick Swardson"}, {"uuid": "79d16a1d-5797-47b3-9dfd-e056390bd73d", "full_name": "Stephen Dorff"}], "directors": [{"uuid": "7bf35b7a-9afb-48b8-b16f-51af5712dde6", "full_name": "Tom Brady"}], "writers": [{"uuid": "3001c484-51a8-4de7-a20b-c4ea1b4a24bb", "full_name": "Adam Sandler"}, {"uuid": "23282104-a71a-4955-89cd-98cc64f9fb75", "full_name": "Allen Covert"}, {"uuid": "161bf1fc-5eaa-483f-bf44-365851513a9d", "full_name": "Nick Swardson"}]}

His life changes when he meets Dorothy Stratten working behind the counter of a Dairy Queen. Dorothy is a pretty but naive high school senior. Paul immediately falls for Dorothy, who sees in Paul a wise, worldly person unlike herself. Paul believes Dorothy is Playboy material, the magazine he sees as only a springboard to bigger and better things. Paul's dream does become a reality: not only does Dorothy eventually marry him, she becomes the August 1979 Playboy Playmate and ultimately Playboy Playmate of 1979, which does indeed lead to the start of an acting career.

Her life is in shambles. She clings to the hope of resurrecting her past movie stardom as a leading ing\u00e9nue.

Before the contractors began their work of tearing down and after the last vestige of the building had been removed, 15 seconds of exposure at normal speed were made. Thus in the finished positive one views at first the old Star Theatre standing as it had for years looking down with serenity upon the bustle of Broadway traffic. Then as if struck by a tornado of supernatural strength, the building begins to crumble. Chimneys totters, walls cave in, and whole stories vanish, until at last the site shows only a cellar excavation; and the Broadway cars with the sidewalk procession continue as if nothing unusual had happened. When this view is shown in the reverse, the effect is very extraordinary.", "genres": [{"uuid": "e4ec414b-558e-4e5d-ab0d-1702b23115c2", "name": "Documentary"}, {"uuid": "1ab184fa-8d01-4fc7-ba12-ad1177c28179", "name": "Short"}], "actors": [], "directors": [{"uuid": "7c7548e6-5fd9-4b21-bcdc-ef4bf1619de2", "full_name": "Frederick S.

Determined that Astrology has no legitimacy, Jake embarks on a journey to test the theory of Astrology by finding the three people born the same time and place as himself - Sarah Reynolds (Jena Malone), Yvette Montgomery (Brooklyn Sudano) and Wesley Henderson (Max Hartman). The journey quickly uproots Jake from the small college town of Berkeley, California, to downtown Chicago where he sets out to find and interview Sarah, Yvette and Wesley to see if their birthdays proved to be as deplorable as his own. Jake's pursuit in finding his three Astrological matches (or Zodiac twins) will not only test his convictions, but validate how life's unexpected twists of fate can deliver much more than the anticipated. The unforeseen takes Jake from the Windy City, to the boardwalk of New Jersey's Atlantic City, to the bustling streets of New York.

But when the lights came up, they all disappeared... Unless you had all the toys. In which case, the adventure never had to end. In backyards, playgrounds, basements, and bedrooms, Star Wars toys helped kids re-enact scenes from their favorite movies, and create entirely new dangers for Luke Skywalker and his friends to face. They were lusted after on holidays and birthdays, swapped with great cunning out on the school yard, and carefully collected like fine treasures. Like no toys before them, the action figures, space ships, play sets, and props were a phenomenon that swept the nation with as much force as the film that inspired them. Along the way they transformed both the toy and movie industries, earned those behind them vast amounts of wealth, and ultimately created a hobby that, 30 years later, still holds sway over not only the people who grew up with the toys, but also an entirely new generation of fans. Plastic Galaxy is a documentary that explores the groundbreaking and breathtaking world of Star Wars toys.

The latest incident in the feud is an on-field brawl between the players worse than they have ever had, which results in an indefinite suspension of both teams from the league pending a full investigation. Each game not played results in a loss and thus less and less chance of either team reaching the post-schedule championship. Beyond the direct measures to have the league lift Invicta's suspension, its owner/president, Jos\u00e9 Carlos Silva, believes another indirect measure is to win in the court of public opinion by currying favor with Philip Andrews, a British documentarian filming a movie about the feud, and whose cameras and stories he hopes will document that Invicta is the innocent victim. To curry that favor, Jos\u00e9, upon Philip's expression of interest, is pushing his innocent daughter, In\u00eas Silva, to date Philip, in who she truly has no interest despite Philip being a decent man. Meanwhile, one Castelo player not involved in that on-field incident is Brit Paul Collins, who was out sick that game and who is nursing a broken heart over a recent break-up with his girlfriend, Danielle. However, Paul and In\u00eas fall in love at first sight when they spot each other across a crowded room at a party. Despite the obstacles, Paul and In\u00eas do clandestinely see each other, with Carla, In\u00eas' paternal grandmother, and Dr. Lawrence, Paul's American physician, reluctantly being their co-conspirators, reluctant in that they are more cognizant about a Paul/In\u00eas relationship being fraught with life long problems.

While Fox and his comrades are recognized as heroes, they've received little in the way of work since Andross's death, and their ship, the Great Fox, has seen much better days. However, one day, as they're approaching Dinosaur Planet at the edge of the Lylat System, they receive a message from General Pepper asking Fox to investigate what's caused the world to suddenly start breaking up and find a way to fix it. At the same time, Dinosaur Planet's inhabitants are under the dictatorial rule of General Scales, whom Fox must contend with in order to complete his mission. And then there's the mysterious Krystal, who became trapped in a large crystal after being attacked within Krazoa Palace.

With his encyclopedic knowledge of her \"body\" and body of work, Don worms his way onto Riversa's good side, no easy task. Not knowing whether to fear or friend Don, Riversa finds herself at the center of a cyclone with Luke and Don both vying for her attention.

Borg Invasion 4D ran from 2004 to 2008. The audience enters a small theater where physically present actors portraying the Star Fleet crew greet them. The story is told through prerecorded 3D film sequences and actors' interaction with them and the audience. The story takes place some time after the end of the ST: Voyager series. The audience takes the roll of guests on a secret space station where Doctor from Voyager works with researches on creating a new DNA strain that will be resistant to the Borg's assimilation techniques. The guests are there to have themselves tested and help the research in case their DNA contains the resistant strain. Then the Borg attack. Actors lead the audience through a couple of hallways as other actors dressed as the Borg assimilate the researchers. Finally, the audience and the \"surviving\" actors reach another small theater that represents an escape shuttle and there a new series of prerecorded 3D film sequences starts. The shuttle launches but the Borg cube with the Queen inside captures it. As the Queen taunts the audience, the Borg are tearing the shuttle apart. Just as they are about to reach the audience, a familiar, charmingly raspy, friendly female voice is heard as well as the sound of proton torpedoes. She disagrees that resistance is futile and is there to prove it.", "genres": [{"uuid": "7a1adc31-1028-4d56-bd65-217991778eb0", "name": "Adventure"}, {"uuid": "1e531601-9b6c-4dce-b9a6-7594fad36c45", "name": "Sci-Fi"}, {"uuid": "1ab184fa-8d01-4fc7-ba12-ad1177c28179", "name": "Short"}], "actors": [{"uuid": "ae9706c9-6969-44e8-8bb1-401c129cd25d", "full_name": "C.

Men are considered mentally inferior and are divided into two categories: the \"adequately intelligent\" who are selected by women to act as their personal \"domestics\" for household chores, and the remainder who are forced to perform menial labor under the supervision of female guards. The guards are attired nicely in visored helmets, boots, hot pants, and elbow-length gloves which are used to control the men through some sort of apparent force. Scientists from Earth (one men and one woman) find their way to the planet, and are forced to take their stated places in society. The man is chosen as a domestic, sometimes is forced to work on a city maintenance crew, and the woman is assigned a white-collar job. The aliens also visit Earth clandestinely in their tear-drop shaped ship.

{"uuid": "e415be40-553a-49fa-84c2-19c94813c974", "title": "Joan Crawford: Always the Star", "imdb_rating": 2.7, "description": "This glamorous and hugely popular actress raised herself from brutal poverty to Academy Award-winning stardom by guts, determination and hard work. During her fifty-year career, she made over eighty films. But her obsessive perfectionism led to the later caricature of coat-hanger-wielding harridan that even the adoration of fans could not counter. Still, she has endured as one of the most popular icons of the movies, an early role model to a million young women who aspired to her image of stylish magnetic power and unquestioned independence. She was born Lucille LeSueur on March 23, 1904 (or 1906) in San Antonio, Texas. Her father soon disappeared and she took the name of her stepfather, calling herself Billie Cassin. When Cassin, too, vanished, Billie did menial work to help her mother and brother survive. Ill-paid sales jobs bought dancing lessons and the clothes she needed to enter amateur contests. Then came a night-club contract as chorus girl - $25-a-week and eight routines a night. And so she made it into show-business, but the humiliations and insecurities of those early years would never entirely leave her. Spotted by an MGM scout, by 1925 she was under contract in Hollywood. She made the usual publicity appearaces and did Exhibition Dancing at night. Her vitality, charm and dancing talents earned her many admirers - including some powerful enough to advance her career, like William Haines, Paul Bern, Jackie Coogan, Sr. and Louis B. Mayer. After bit parts and a small role in the film Pretty Ladies, a studio-sponsored competition found her the name she at first hated: Joan Crawford. As Crawford's acting skills developed, she became known for her independence and her resilience despite some less-than-successful roles. Her vaguely pretty and plump early looks were soon replaced by the svelte, hard-boiled beauty of hollow-cheeks, thick brows and overpainted mouth that would be her permanent image. Her capacity to inspire and wear with flair the creations of the dress designer Adrian was legendary. But most of all, she was known for her hard work on the set. Joan Crawford's personal life was characterized equally by self-discipline and the determination to better herself, banishing forever her unhappy beginnings. Four husbands included actors Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, Franchot Tone, Phillip Terry and businessman Alfred Steele. Plagued by innumerable miscarriages, she adopted four children, one of whose account of Joan's unyielding perfectionism has succeded in blurring memories of the remarkable life and career of a Hollywood immortal. Among Joan Crawford's films from which clips are included: Sally, Irene and Mary, 1925; Our Dancing Daughters, 1928; Grand Hotel, 1932; Dancing Lady, 1933; The Gorgeous Hussy, 1936; The Women, 1939; A Woman's Face, 1941; Mildred Pierce, 1945; Humoresque, 1946; Possessed, 1947; Sudden Fear, 1952; Johnny Guitar, 1954 Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? 1962 and Strait Jacket, 1964.", "genres": [{"uuid": "e4ec414b-558e-4e5d-ab0d-1702b23115c2", "name": "Documentary"}], "actors": [{"uuid": "3c286716-b594-4df0-a321-7252f755ab52", "full_name": "Ben Cooper"}, {"uuid": "6df6ef2c-c12f-49a8-ab61-e83f3c69fb2d", "full_name": "Cliff Robertson"}, {"uuid": "5fd10fea-00da-4cac-abef-402e3d1421b9", "full_name": "Diane Baker"}, {"uuid": "f9830af8-93cc-4183-b1ca-d355fcee89a6", "full_name": "Joan Crawford"}], "directors": [{"uuid": "c1d2f51f-7820-4b99-9ad5-f9d76462a42d", "full_name": "Gene Feldman"}, {"uuid": "43d7e8f1-c7e5-47ae-87ab-93f86c6a22e8", "full_name": "Suzette Winter"}], "writers": [{"uuid": "c1d2f51f-7820-4b99-9ad5-f9d76462a42d", "full_name": "Gene Feldman"}, {"uuid": "43d7e8f1-c7e5-47ae-87ab-93f86c6a22e8", "full_name": "Suzette Winter"}]}

In the four years that follow there is no question that rapping has brought Priscilla closer to her estranged father, and that her success has made him proud. Before our eyes, this father-daughter duo go from a one-bedroom shelter in Harlem to a 4 bedroom apartment, from food stamps to shopping sprees, from rapping on street corners to sold out night clubs, and from sneaking under train turnstiles without the $2 fare to spare to being driven around in tinted SUV's. It is further undeniable that Jesse has been reborn, from looking at old photos and bitterly reflecting on how he never was given the respect he deserved in the music business as a rapper himself to finding his own voice and self-respect as his daughter's overzealous manager. But in the efforts to make her dad proud, Priscilla struggles to remain a child and finds herself trapped in a world of people twice her size and four times her age and doesn't know who to trust. Jesse himself is caught between wanting to protect his daughter' innocence and exploiting her raw talent to fulfill his deferred dream.

Baze and Chirrut: Guardians of the Whills: The actors discuss landing and accepting the roles, the characters' camaraderie, individual character details, faith and the force in the movie and the Star Wars universe, and the actors' physical performances. Bodhi and Saw: The Pilot and The Revolutionary: The piece begins with Riz Ahmed's auditions and crafting the character, the character's fate, and making key sequences. It moves on to examine Forest Whitaker's character and his history in the Star Wars universe, character definition and history, Whitaker's preparations for the role, and more. The Empire: A run through of key Imperial characters, including Galen Erso, Orson Krennic, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Darth Vader and the qualities (and in Vader's case, the presence) their actors brought to their roles. Visions of Hope: The Look of Rogue One: Designing a world that's true and familiar to the Star Wars universe but still unique to the film. It explores set construction, small design changes, and the black stormtroopers. The Princess and The Governor: Digitally recreating two important characters.

Their journey exposes them to danger and cruelty; however it also exposes them to the unexpected kindness of the people involved in the Underground Railroad.

While the Castro brothers face their certain end, an uncertain future hangs over the island. Some people are afraid, many cannot wait, but all shudder and hope that the changes will be positive. This documentary leads the audience through the discovery of this hope, through a tourist's camera which looks to be turned off and oblivious to the conversation at hand, yet is focused on candidly capturing each person's wishes. There is the old guerrillero who took part in the revolution, the lady who met Che Guevara and lives thanks to the government social card, and also the young boys and girls - those who wish to make a career within the rules, as well as those who only try to escape abroad. Clandestine underground shops, businessmen experienced in all things illegal, dodgy pimps, mothers who force their daughters into selling their bodies - the hidden face of the State which welcomes tourists into its luxury resorts is openly displayed beyond censorship's control. One special guide is Yoani Sanchez, the independent blogger, a leader of the new, peaceful revolution - the revolution of ideas. The internet is its main instrument, while the government attempts to limit computer use with any means possible in a pushing and pulling of ideals. In the interview, recorded in a secret location, the young writer speaks about her country's ruin, and where Raul's reforms have no effect on everyday life. Castro's supporters and dissidents, young and old - none deceive themselves that the star of the revolution will shine on for much longer. And this is what this project focuses on: the wishes on a falling star.", "genres": [{"uuid": "e4ec414b-558e-4e5d-ab0d-1702b23115c2", "name": "Documentary"}, {"uuid": "b1fe41ee-cee7-4769-9935-4ea5b7e7d8f0", "name": "History"}, {"uuid": "f00050c2-712f-4f26-b163-8805bcacd1e3", "name": "News"}], "actors": [{"uuid": "48feb147-f0a9-4640-8f07-f0d5b9326346", "full_name": "Giammarco Sicuro"}, {"uuid": "1218cab1-739a-4e8b-9d37-e2fe611aec96", "full_name": "Jacopo Cecconi"}, {"uuid": "08fc2073-3acb-48b2-a387-49ea63803c1e", "full_name": "Matthew Mercer"}, {"uuid": "5fea54bd-5d07-4f96-962c-4452f6adb0b8", "full_name": "Yoani Sanchez"}], "directors": [{"uuid": "48feb147-f0a9-4640-8f07-f0d5b9326346", "full_name": "Giammarco Sicuro"}, {"uuid": "1218cab1-739a-4e8b-9d37-e2fe611aec96", "full_name": "Jacopo Cecconi"}, {"uuid": "8047443c-3f9c-41cb-93bd-da9cff89f7fb", "full_name": "Paolo Cellammare"}], "writers": [{"uuid": "48feb147-f0a9-4640-8f07-f0d5b9326346", "full_name": "Giammarco Sicuro"}, {"uuid": "1218cab1-739a-4e8b-9d37-e2fe611aec96", "full_name": "Jacopo Cecconi"}, {"uuid": "8047443c-3f9c-41cb-93bd-da9cff89f7fb", "full_name": "Paolo Cellammare"}]}

The manager called his press agent in, scolded him and ordered him to secure a vaudeville team, adding that \"they must be extremely funny and extremely cheap.\" Within a short time the agent returned and proudly announced he had found \"an absolute novelty, and a joint salary of $15.\" \"I dodged all the agencies,\" he explained, \"and down on one of the side streets I ran across an old-time ham actor. I followed him. He went into a laundry and tried to get his duds out without paying for them. Well, the woman who ran the joint was a regular comedy queen. She didn't say much, but she certainly was full of 'pep.' She nearly wrecked the laundry with that actor, and I never laughed so much in my life. When I offered them an engagement the man balked, but the woman accepted for both of them, saying he could work out his laundry bill anyhow.\" The manager tried the act out, and it made a big hit. The morning papers gave much space to the \"Soap Suds Star,\" Sophie, the laundress. Much to his dismay, however, the press agent found the manager in an extremely bad humor. \"It's all your fault,\" he said bitterly, \"You get me to hire amateurs, and now they are going to be married, and quit vaudeville for the classics.\" \"I think it a dandy idea,\" said the agent. \"Sophie as Juliet would coin money for any manager. Why not try them out in the balcony scene\" The manager, impressed, retained his \"Soap Suds Star,\" and his leading man. Sophie s bad temper, however, spoiled her artistic career. She was on the job as Juliet, all right, but Romeo nearly missed the performance, and when he did appear he wore his street clothes, explaining with an alcoholic smile that he had been out with the boys and really had no time to dress. Sophie left her art to chastise him, but after a lively chase he escaped by leaping into the river, and the one-time actress returned to her laundry, believing she was a widow. But her husband came back and Sophie forgave him. Then, finding that his clothes had been well sprinkled in the river, she ironed him out, and gave him a life position in the laundry.", "genres": [{"uuid": "7c3697f0-880d-4852-9e6d-397573e1ab74", "name": "Comedy"}, {"uuid": "1ab184fa-8d01-4fc7-ba12-ad1177c28179", "name": "Short"}], "actors": [{"uuid": "01bd7751-67e3-4cf9-83cd-9a624c1d69fa", "full_name": "Carey L.
